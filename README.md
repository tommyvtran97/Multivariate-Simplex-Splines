## Multivariate Simplex Splines using F16 Flight Data

A multivariate simplex spline model is created using the reference F16 flight data. The document consist of three steps:

* Part 2) State & Parameters estimation with F16 flight data
* Part 3) Deriving a simplex polynomial
* Part 4) System Identificiation with Simplex Splines

To generate the model results and the show the sensitivity analysis run the `main.m` in each of the folders. Note that running the script in `Part 4` may take several minutes.
